# CLARIN Human Interface Guidelines

The CLARIN Human Interface Guidelines were developed in the context of [CLARIN-PLUS](https://www.clarin.eu/content/factsheet-clarin-plus). 

The actual [guidelines document](https://office.clarin.eu/v/CE-2016-0794-CLARINPLUS-D3_1.pdf) can be found among the [CLARIN-PLUS deliverables](https://www.clarin.eu/content/clarin-plus-deliverables) as D3.1.

Additional information can be found on the [Branding page of the CLARIN Trac](https://trac.clarin.eu/wiki/Branding).

## Style implementation
A Bootstrap/LESS style based on these guidelines has been implemented and is maintained at and available from https://github.com/clarin-eric/base_style.
